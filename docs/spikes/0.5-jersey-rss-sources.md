## Recommendations for Handling Unreliable/Unavailable Feeds

### 1. Feed Unavailability

```
Strategy: Implement graceful degradation
- Cache last successful fetch results
- Display cached data with "Last updated" timestamp
- Show user-friendly message when feeds are unavailable
- Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
```

### 2. Web Scraping Fallback

For sources without RSS feeds (Jersey Fraud Prevention Forum, Trading Standards):

```
Implementation:
1. Create scheduled scraping jobs (respect robots.txt)
2. Parse HTML for news/alert sections
3. Store in local database with deduplication
4. Generate internal RSS-like feed for application consumption
5. Implement rate limiting (recommend: max 1 request per hour)
```

### 3. Feed Validation

```
Checks to implement:
- Validate XML/RSS format on fetch
- Check for required fields (title, link, pubDate)
- Detect stale feeds (no updates in 30+ days)
- Monitor for format changes
```

### 4. Manual Verification Steps

Before production deployment:

1. **JFSC Feeds:** Confirm feed URLs are active and returning valid RSS
2. **Report Fraud Feed:** Verify SiteId=149 returns Action Fraud content
3. **NCSC Feeds:** Test both feed URLs for accessibility
4. **Contact Authorities:** Email Jersey Fraud Prevention Forum and Trading Standards to confirm web scraping is permitted or request official feeds

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting

```
Implement monitoring for:
- Feed fetch failures (3+ consecutive failures = alert)
- Format changes in feed structure
- Extended periods without updates (may indicate source issues)
- SSL certificate expiry on feed endpoints
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Implement JFSC RSS feed integration
2. **Short-term:** Add Report Fraud (UK) and NCSC feeds
3. **Medium-term:** Develop web scraping for Jersey Fraud Prevention Forum
4. **Ongoing:** Contact local authorities about additional feed options
